# Keymap
## How to get keycode
See [doc/keycode.txt](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/blob/master/doc/keycode.txt).
Keycodes are actually defined in [common/keycode.h](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/blob/master/common/keycode.h).

## Sysrq key
Use keycode for Print Screen(`KC_PSCREEN` or `KC_PSCR`) instead of `KC_SYSREQ`. Key combination of 'Alt + Print Screen' is recognized as 'System request'.

See [issue #168](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/issues/168) and
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_request

## Power key doesn't work
Use `KC_PWR` instead of `KC_POWER` or vice versa.
- `KC_PWR` works with Windows and Linux, not with OSX.
- `KC_POWER` works with OSX and Linux, not with Windows.

## Oneshot modifier
Solves my personal 'the' problem. I often got 'the' or 'THe' wrongly instead of 'The'.  Oneshot Shift mitgates this for me.

## Modifier/Layer stuck
Modifier keys or layers can be stuck unless layer switching is configured properly.
For Modifier keys and layer actions you have to place `KC_TRANS` on same position of destination layer to  unregister the modifier key or return to previous layer on release event.

## Mechanical Lock Switch Support
https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard#mechanical-locking-support

This feature is for *mechanical lock switch* like this Alps one.
http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCL_Lock

Using enabling this feature and using keycodes `LCAP`, `LNUM` or `LSCR` in keymap you can use physical locking CapsLock, NumLock or ScrollLock keys as you expected.

Old vintage mechanical keyboards occasionally have lock switches but modern ones don't have. ***You don't need this feature in most case and just use keycodes `CAPS`, `NLCK` and `SLCK`.***


## Input special charactors other than ASCII like Cédille 'Ç'
NO UNIVERSAL METHOD TO INPUT THOSE WORKS OVER ALL SYSTEMS. You have to define **MACRO** in way specific to your OS or layout.

See this post for example **MACRO** code.

http://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/tmk-keyboard-firmware-collection-t4478-120.html#p195620

On **Windows** you can use `AltGr` key or **Alt code**.
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_code

On **Mac** OS defines `Option` key combinations.
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_key#Alternative_keyboard_input

On **Xorg** you can use `compose` key, instead.
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key

And see this for **Unicode** input.
